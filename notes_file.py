# py files 
# in the notebook is the code for building all the functions for the getting 
# and then a cleaned up notebook 
# can put all code into functions and then put the functions in a py file 
# make a lot of functions
# file scripts and file tester of something like that you can import functions you made in the py file and use them in the notebook
# chnage directory up a level 
# chnage the dicirectory and push it back one and have to refresh the kernal each time you change the directory 
# any package the code needs needs to be at the top of the py file when you import the function it import the imports in the py file. 
# makes the notebook cleaner, like could have a function to pull a chart and then call the function instead of all the code needed to make the chart 
# test in a notebook to make sure it works
# from folder.file import function_name
# import os, if you do not restart it will keep moving one up everytime it is run
